# password-generator

In this project I assited the user to generate a randomized password by:
  * prompting the user for the desired number of characters in the password (between 8 - 128 total)
  * validated that the appropriate number characters were selected
  * asked user what type of characters they wanted in the password -
            - Uppercase letters
            - Lowercase letters
            - Special characters
            - Numbers
  
  * ensured that if user did not select any of the character options a password woudl still be generated
  * displayed password once all prompts were answered
